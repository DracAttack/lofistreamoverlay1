The Actual Problem:
When you select an asset for a layer, it updates temporarily in memory, but then:

An auto-refresh or redraw runs, overwriting your change with a stale layout state

Or, your saveLayout() or applyConfig() method is being called immediately after asset selection — but it uses an old layout snapshot, so it erases your selection

🧠 What That Means in Code:
You probably have something like:
js
Copy
Edit
layer.assignedAsset = asset.id; // This works for a moment
renderLayout(); // gets called automatically afterward
But renderLayout() is reading from an old saved layout that still has assignedAsset = null.

✅ Here's How to Fix It
🛠️ Step 1: Ensure layer state is updated in your shared layout object
Make sure when you assign an asset, you're modifying the actual shared layout state, not a temp local clone.

js
Copy
Edit
layout.layers[layerIndex].assignedAsset = asset.id;
Not:

js
Copy
Edit
let tempLayer = layer;
tempLayer.assignedAsset = asset.id; // won’t persist
🛠️ Step 2: Delay or prevent auto-renders immediately after selection
If your app does something like:

js
Copy
Edit
setTimeout(() => applyLayoutFromStorage(), 500);
Or:

js
Copy
Edit
onChange(() => loadLayout())
You need to suppress that momentarily after manual edits.

🛠️ Step 3: Force sync layout before re-rendering
After assigning an asset, explicitly call your own layout sync method.

js
Copy
Edit
assignAssetToLayer(layerId, assetId) {
  layout.layers[layerId].assignedAsset = assetId;
  saveLayout(); // ensure it writes correctly
  renderLayout(); // optional, only if needed immediately
}
✅ Step 4: Confirm saveLayout() actually writes to shared storage
Sometimes saveLayout() might be misbehaving, like:

Writing an outdated snapshot (layout vs currentLayout)

Not serializing correctly (check for undefined or circular refs)

Not overwriting the previous file/db key

Try logging:

js
Copy
Edit
console.log("Saving layout:", JSON.stringify(layout));
Then reload the stream output page — if your selection isn’t there, the save didn’t actually write.

🧪 Final Debugging Tip:
Add this after saving an asset to a layer:

js
Copy
Edit
console.log("Assigned", asset.id, "to", layer.id);
console.log("Current layout:", JSON.stringify(layout));
If you see the right asset ID but it disappears visually afterward → you’ve got a bad overwrite or a stale re-render.
