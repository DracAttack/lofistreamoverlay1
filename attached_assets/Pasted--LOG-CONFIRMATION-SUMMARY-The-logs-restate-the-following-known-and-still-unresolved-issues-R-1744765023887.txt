🔍 LOG CONFIRMATION SUMMARY:
The logs restate the following known (and still unresolved) issues:

❗Resizing Problems
Values jump erratically (0px → 8000px)

Likely because the drag/resize handler is not referencing cached original sizes

No min/max clamping in effect yet

❗Dragging Bug
isDragging stays true after release

Missing global mouseup and mouseleave to end it cleanly

❗Changes apply instantly
No “draft state” for layout changes

Still pushing updates to /stream in real-time

❗UI Controls still messy
Reset/undo/grid snap appear in multiple places

✅ NEXT MOVE: Instruct Replit AI to focus only on resizing bug now, with precision
Here’s what you should tell it next, assuming this log didn’t lead to success:

🛠️ NEXT REPLIT INSTRUCTION: FIX RESIZE ONLY
🧠 CURRENT SITUATION:
Resizing layers in PreviewPanel.tsx causes huge jumps in size (0px or 8000px), instead of smooth scale changes.

❗ROOT PROBLEM:
Resize is not using a cached baseline

You're calculating new width/height from the current mouse position directly, which causes instability

There is no clamping to enforce min/max bounds

✅ REQUIRED FIXES:
🔧 1. Add resize start cache
Inside PreviewPanel.tsx, store starting size and mouse position:

ts
Copy
Edit
const [resizeStart, setResizeStart] = useState({
  startX: 0,
  startY: 0,
  startWidth: 0,
  startHeight: 0
});
Then when resizing begins:

ts
Copy
Edit
setResizeStart({
  startX: e.clientX,
  startY: e.clientY,
  startWidth: currentLayer.width,
  startHeight: currentLayer.height
});
🔧 2. Calculate deltas from the original size
ts
Copy
Edit
const deltaX = e.clientX - resizeStart.startX;
const deltaY = e.clientY - resizeStart.startY;

const newWidth = resizeStart.startWidth + deltaX;
const newHeight = resizeStart.startHeight + deltaY;
🔧 3. Clamp to avoid 0 or 8000
ts
Copy
Edit
const clampedWidth = Math.max(50, Math.min(2000, newWidth));
const clampedHeight = Math.max(50, Math.min(2000, newHeight));
🔧 4. Update live preview from clamped values
Update the state only with clamped size.

TL;DR:
Stop calculating width/height directly from live mouse position.
Instead, cache the size on drag start, calculate delta, and clamp output.
