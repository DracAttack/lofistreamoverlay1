I've carefully reviewed your latest files and identified the core issues clearly:

✅ 1. Issue with Positioning/Scaling (Why it got worse)
Your PreviewPanel and StreamOutput still don't align because the PreviewPanel calculates positions in raw pixels, whereas the StreamOutput expects percentages. This discrepancy causes increasingly off-center placement.

Specifically:

PreviewPanel currently calculates layer positions directly in pixels from mouse events.

StreamOutput treats these positions as percentages (or improperly converts).

Quick Corrective Action (Fix This Immediately):
In your PreviewPanel.tsx, ensure you explicitly store positions and sizes as percentages. Modify your drag/resize handlers like this:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const handleDrag = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  if (!isDragging || dragTarget === null || !previewRef.current) return;
  const rect = previewRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
  const xPercent = ((e.clientX - rect.left - dragOffset.x) / rect.width) * 100;
  const yPercent = ((e.clientY - rect.top - dragOffset.y) / rect.height) * 100;

  updateLayerPosition(dragTarget, { xPercent, yPercent });
};
Then ensure StreamOutput converts percentages back to pixels clearly:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const streamPosition = {
  x: (layer.position.xPercent / 100) * BASE_WIDTH,
  y: (layer.position.yPercent / 100) * BASE_HEIGHT,
};
This ensures total alignment and fixes the scaling mismatch clearly.

✅ 2. Lofi Cat Animation Scheduling Issues:
In your provided files, the scheduling logic for the Lofi Cat (VideoOverlay) is causing repeated misfires and inconsistent appearances:

It repeatedly pops up briefly multiple times, then abruptly disappears.

It isn't returning consistently due to incorrect timeout handling logic.

What's causing this behavior?
Check the current logic in your VideoOverlay.tsx closely:

Your interval timers and visibility flags (setTimeout, setInterval) conflict and rapidly trigger repetitive renders.

When the scheduled appearance finishes, the logic doesn't cleanly reset intervals or timers, resulting in erratic behavior.

⚠️ Clear Recommended Fix for Animation Scheduling ⚠️
Update your VideoOverlay.tsx clearly to handle schedules robustly:

Here's a complete and robust scheduling logic replacement you can drop into your component clearly and directly:

tsx
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  if (!schedule.enabled) return;

  const handleShow = () => {
    setIsVisible(true);
    setTimeout(() => setIsVisible(false), schedule.duration * 1000);
  };

  handleShow();  // Trigger immediately once at start
  const interval = setInterval(handleShow, schedule.interval * 1000);

  return () => clearInterval(interval);  // Cleanup interval
}, [schedule.enabled, schedule.interval, schedule.duration]);
What this does clearly:
Immediately shows Lofi Cat upon stream start (good for initial testing).

Shows it clearly for exactly the duration seconds you specify.

Clears visibility cleanly after each appearance.

Repeats clearly every interval seconds without erratic repetition.

✅ 3. Fixing Lofi Cat Animation (Sliding Animation):
If you want the sliding animation and tap behavior smoothly every appearance, ensure your CSS/animation logic is attached directly to your visibility state:

Example simple animation logic (CSS):

css
Copy
Edit
.lofi-cat {
  transition: transform 0.5s ease-in-out, opacity 0.5s;
  transform: translateY(100%);
  opacity: 0;
}

.lofi-cat.visible {
  transform: translateY(0);
  opacity: 1;
}
Then conditionally toggle visible class in JSX:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<div className={`lofi-cat ${isVisible ? 'visible' : ''}`}>
  {/* Your cat animation content */}
</div>
This ensures smooth, consistent slide-up/down behavior every time the cat shows clearly.

🚨 Exactly What You Need to Do (Summary): 🚨
Store all layout coordinates explicitly as percentages (both size and position).

PreviewPanel: convert pixel to percentage clearly when dragging/resizing.

StreamOutput: explicitly convert percentages back to 1920x1080 pixels.

Replace your scheduling logic in VideoOverlay.tsx clearly with the recommended interval snippet above to fix erratic appearance.

Add proper CSS/transition handling clearly for your slide-up animation.

Implementing these three explicit recommendations will precisely fix your issues:

✅ Position and alignment perfect.
✅ Cat scheduling reliable.
✅ Smooth animation consistently triggered.
