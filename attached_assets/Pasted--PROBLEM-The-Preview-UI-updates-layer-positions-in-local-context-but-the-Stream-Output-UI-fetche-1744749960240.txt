ðŸ§¨ PROBLEM:
The Preview UI updates layer positions in local context, but the Stream Output UI fetches layer positions from the API, which are never being updated with the drag/drop actions.

ðŸ§  In Plain English:
You're dragging things around on the Preview screen

But those new positions are only saved in memory (inside React context)

The StreamOutput fetches fresh data from /api/layers, which still has the original, untouched layout

Thatâ€™s why your elements show up in the same spot on the stream output no matter what.

âœ… SOLUTION (What Needs to Happen)
In your PreviewPanel.tsx:

When a user drags or resizes a layer, you must call a backend API that:

Updates the database (or whatever API /api/layers pulls from)

Ensures those new positions are reflected for StreamOutput.tsx

You already have apiRequest() and queryClient imported â€” you're nearly there.

âœ… Fix (Add This to Your handleDrag or updateLayerPosition Logic)
After updating position client-side, do this:

ts
Copy
Edit
await apiRequest(`/api/layers/${layer.id}`, {
  method: "PATCH",
  body: {
    position: {
      x,
      y,
      width: layer.position.width,
      height: layer.position.height,
    },
  },
});

// Invalidate the layer query to reflect changes everywhere
queryClient.invalidateQueries(['/api/layers']);
Example patch call:
If your backend is set up with a PATCH /api/layers/:id, this will sync the new position to your database or in-memory store used by /api/layers.

ðŸ‘‡ You Should Place This Inside:
The part of handleDrag or handleDrop where the final position is committed.

Or inside your existing updateLayerPosition() method if you centralize updates there.

ðŸ”„ And in StreamOutput.tsx â€” You're Already Good!
ts
Copy
Edit
const { data: layers = [] } = useQuery<Layer[]>({
  queryKey: ['/api/layers'],
  refetchInterval: 5000
});
This means the stream view will automatically reflect new positions as long as theyâ€™re saved properly.

ðŸ’¥ Once You Do This:
Stream preview becomes WYSIWYG

Drag something in Preview â†’ it updates in realtime on the stream

You'll be one step away from full live editing
