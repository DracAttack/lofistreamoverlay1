Most Likely Causes:
🔻 1. Broken Reference Binding
When you updated your layout handling, the asset-layer link might’ve been disconnected.

Example: The layer objects no longer have a valid .assetId or .source property.

Or your layer creation system isn’t assigning them with a null default to start with.

✅ Fix: On layer creation, make sure every layer object starts with assignedAsset = null and then updates when clicked.

🔻 2. Event Listeners Not Rebound
If you dynamically reload or rerender the asset list or the layers, you may need to rebind click listeners every time.

js
Copy
Edit
document.querySelectorAll('.asset-thumbnail').forEach(el => {
  el.addEventListener('click', () => assignAssetToLayer(layerId, assetId));
});
✅ Fix: Ensure click listeners are being re-attached after UI updates.

🔻 3. Asset List and Layer Logic Out of Sync
If your asset list is in a global variable (like assets = []) and something overwrote or cleared it — your click handler is now pointing at nothing.

✅ Fix:

Log assets in dev tools

Confirm it still contains your files after uploading

Confirm your layer object has an assetId or src value

🔻 4. Config Got Corrupted (JSON mismatch)
If your layout or asset objects were malformed (missing keys, bad JSON save), the dropdown/select logic may fail silently.

✅ Fix:

Print console.log(currentLayout)

Manually inspect: Do each layer and asset have a consistent ID or path?

🛠️ Debug Checklist
js
Copy
Edit
// Run these in console or add logs
console.log("Assets:", assets);                // Should show your uploaded files
console.log("Layers:", currentLayout.layers);  // Should show layer objects
Then make sure each asset has:

js
Copy
Edit
{ id: "asset123", type: "video", url: "/static/uploaded.mp4" }
And each layer has:

js
Copy
Edit
{ id: "layer1", assignedAsset: "asset123", position: { x: 100, y: 100 } }
🧪 Quick Fix Ideas
✅ 1. Fallback Binding
In your layer asset assignment UI:

js
Copy
Edit
if (!layer.assignedAsset) {
  layer.assignedAsset = asset.id;
}
✅ 2. Visual Debugging
Add some red box to your asset divs and log which asset gets clicked.

js
Copy
Edit
<div class="asset-thumbnail" onclick="assignAssetToLayer('layer1', 'asset123')">
