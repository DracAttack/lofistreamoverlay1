üß® THE PROBLEM:
Your Stream Output page is scaling to the browser window and centering the container, instead of stretching to fill edge-to-edge.
That‚Äôs why it:

Looks perfect in Preview (which is sandboxed in 16:9)

Looks cropped or letterboxed in Stream view

Loses margins or slices edges (like that neon arrow on the right) ‚Äî because you‚Äôre probably positioning based on exact 1920x1080 logic but not enforcing that canvas in Stream

‚úÖ THE FIX: Force your Stream Output container to behave like OBS expects
üß± Step 1: Apply a locked 1920x1080 canvas
Wrap your entire StreamOutput renderer in a full-screen, fixed-aspect container:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<div
  className="stream-canvas"
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    width: "1920px",
    height: "1080px",
    overflow: "hidden",
    backgroundColor: "black",
    margin: "0 auto",
  }}
>
  {/* all your layers go here */}
</div>
That way, OBS captures exactly what you see.

üß± Step 2: Prevent browser shrink/stretch
In your /stream page or component, ensure this is set at the highest level:

css
Copy
Edit
html, body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: hidden;
  background: black;
}
This prevents the browser from trying to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù by adding spacing or scrollbars.

üß± Step 3: Avoid % scaling in StreamOutput (if using absolute drag)
Since you're positioning layers based on pixel dimensions in Preview, you must match that exact scale in Stream view. That means:

Don‚Äôt use width: 100% or aspect-ratio: auto

Lock everything into px values, or move to % scaling on both sides (but that‚Äôs a whole rewrite)

‚úÖ Optional Step: Fullscreen scaling for OBS browser source
If you do want to allow OBS to scale the 1920x1080 canvas to 4K or other resolutions:

css
Copy
Edit
html, body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
  margin: 0;
}

.stream-canvas {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 56.25vw; /* 1080p in 16:9 ratio */
  max-height: 100vh;
  position: relative;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
That way it stays centered, responsive, and scales cleanly.

‚úÖ TL;DR: Final Fix Summary

Issue	Fix
Stream output is clipped	Force canvas to 1920x1080 px
Layout doesn't match preview	Match fixed px positioning with matching container dimensions
OBS output crops edges	Remove scrollbars, margins, and enforce overflow: hidden
Aspect ratio drift	Lock aspect-ratio: 16 / 9 on stream container
