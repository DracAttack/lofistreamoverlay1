🧠 CURRENT SITUATION:
You're using percent-based layout with drag and resize features in PreviewPanel.tsx, but:

Resizing is wildly unstable, often snapping to 0px or 8000px

Elements keep dragging even after releasing the mouse

No debounce or delta calculation causes snapping/jumping

Layout changes instantly update Stream Output, without a commit step

The UI is getting cluttered, with too many controls at the bottom

Loop behavior is tied only to scheduling — there's no “loop freely” option

✅ PROPOSED ENHANCEMENTS (LET REPLIT HANDLE THESE PATCHES):
🔧 1. 🪄 Fix Resizing Instability
Update handleResize() to:

Clamp width/height between 5% and 200%

Use startWidth/startHeight state to calculate delta (not raw drag distance)

Prevent any resize from pushing an element off-canvas

ts
Copy
Edit
width: Math.max(5, Math.min(200, calculatedWidth)),
height: Math.max(5, Math.min(200, calculatedHeight))
🔧 2. 🛑 Fix Drag That Doesn’t Stop
Currently isDragging stays true after mouse is released.

Fix:

Add window.addEventListener("mouseup", stopDrag) and mouseleave

In stopDrag(), call setIsDragging(false) and flush any drag delta

This ensures dragging ends immediately when the user lets go.

🔧 3. 🗂 Enable “Commit Before Apply” Workflow
Right now changes in PreviewPanel apply instantly.

Fix:

Store changes to layer position and size in temporary draft state

Only sync with /stream or the backend after clicking “Save Layout”

This lets me reposition and resize freely before committing

🔧 4. 🔁 Add “Loop Freely” Toggle in Timer UI
Currently videos only loop via timers.

Fix:

Add a checkbox:

[ ] Loop video continuously (ignore schedule)

When this is enabled:

Hide the interval/duration fields

The video should use native loop + autoplay

🔧 5. 🧲 Snap-to-Grid and Snap-to-Center
Add snapping logic on drag/resize release:

ts
Copy
Edit
function snapToGrid(value: number, step = 5): number {
  return Math.round(value / step) * step;
}

function snapToCenter(value: number, container: number, threshold = 3): number {
  const center = container / 2;
  return Math.abs(value - center) < threshold ? center : value;
}
Apply this in onDragEnd and onResizeEnd.

🔧 6. 🧼 Clean Up UI Clutter
The buttons like “Reset,” “Undo,” “Snap to Grid” etc. are duplicated.

Fix:

Remove the old “Layer Tools” section at the bottom

Keep only the row of icons just under the Preview window

Ensure these icons are clearly labeled and easy to click

🔧 7. 🔄 Undo/Reset Support
Add a layerHistory stack using useRef or useState([])

Push to stack on any drag or resize change

“Undo” button should pop the last layout

“Reset” should return selected layer to:

ts
Copy
Edit
{ x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100 }
✅ TL;DR SUMMARY

Problem	Fix
Elements resize to 0 or explode	Clamp width/height, use delta from cached start
Drag keeps going after mouse up	Add global mouseup and mouseleave listeners
No way to “Save” before applying	Buffer changes, apply on “Save Layout”
No loop mode	Add toggle to loop video freely
Layout jumpy	Add grid + center snap logic
UI cluttered	Remove bottom panel, consolidate to top row
No Undo/Reset	Add layer history + buttons
