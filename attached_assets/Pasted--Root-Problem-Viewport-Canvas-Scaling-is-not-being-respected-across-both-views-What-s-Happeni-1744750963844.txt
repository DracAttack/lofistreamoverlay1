🧨 Root Problem: Viewport / Canvas Scaling is not being respected across both views
✅ What’s Happening in PreviewPanel:
You scale and position layers visually relative to a container (previewRef)

Drag/resizing uses pixel-based math relative to the preview div’s getBoundingClientRect()

This works beautifully in that window only, because it’s mapped to the preview’s canvas size

❌ What StreamOutput Is Doing:
StreamOutput just reads raw .position values from the database, without any context of:

Aspect ratio

Base resolution

Scaling

So it treats { x: 400, y: 200, width: 300, height: 100 } as absolute pixel values, not scaled values

🎯 Result:
Layers appear stacked, huge, or misaligned

Because their absolute positions are only valid relative to PreviewPanel’s scaling

And StreamOutput is rendering them in a totally different coordinate space (often 1920x1080)

✅ Solution
🔧 Fix 1: Store positions in % (relative units)
On drag/resize inside PreviewPanel, convert pixel-based positions to percentages of container width/height before saving to DB.

ts
Copy
Edit
const container = previewRef.current.getBoundingClientRect();
const relativeX = (absoluteX / container.width) * 100;
const relativeY = (absoluteY / container.height) * 100;
const relativeW = (absoluteWidth / container.width) * 100;
const relativeH = (absoluteHeight / container.height) * 100;
Save these as { xPercent, yPercent, widthPercent, heightPercent } in your position field

🔧 Fix 2: In StreamOutput, apply the % back into pixel space
When rendering layers, use:

ts
Copy
Edit
const container = containerRef.current?.getBoundingClientRect();
const layerStyle = {
  left: `${(layer.position.xPercent || 0)}%`,
  top: `${(layer.position.yPercent || 0)}%`,
  width: `${(layer.position.widthPercent || 0)}%`,
  height: `${(layer.position.heightPercent || 0)}%`,
  position: "absolute",
};
✅ This keeps every element perfectly aligned no matter the size of the window, tab, browser source, or monitor.

🔧 Bonus Fix: Normalize aspect ratio
Since you have an aspectRatio prop on both components, enforce a base rendering canvas like:

css
Copy
Edit
.preview-container {
  aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1920px;
  position: relative;
}
So PreviewPanel and StreamOutput are working in the same space.

🧠 TL;DR

Problem	Fix
Elements are misaligned/stuck	Normalize position into percentage units on save
Different canvas sizes	Use consistent aspect-ratio containers in both Preview and Output
Scaling not respected	Render elements with left/top/width/height in %
